This folder contains a series of templates, as examples, that will be used to produce the simulation files. 
- kratos_airfoil_compressible: Kratos Multiphysics airfoil simulation. Full potential model with compressible element formulation.
- kratos_airfoil_transonic: Kratos Multiphysics airfoil simulation. Full potential model with transonic element formulation. Iteratively finds the parameters by performing a series of simulations as an outer loop.
- xfoil_airfoil: XFOIL airfoil simulation. Panel method.

You can similarly create your own model. Use a $var to indicate a variable. A double dollar sign means no replacement.

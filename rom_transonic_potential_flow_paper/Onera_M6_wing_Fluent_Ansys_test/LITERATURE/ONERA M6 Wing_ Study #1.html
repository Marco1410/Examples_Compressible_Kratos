<h3 class="style1">Introduction</h3>

<p> This study is an example study demonstrating the application of the
WIND code for solving the three-dimensional, transonic, turbulent flow
over the ONERA M6 wing.</p>


<!---------------------------------------------------------------------->
<h3 class="style1">Download tar File</h3>

<p> Most of the files for this example study are available in the Unix
compressed tar file <a href="https://www.grc.nasa.gov/WWW/wind/valid/m6wing/m6wing01/m6wing01.tar.Z"> m6wing01.tar.Z</a>.  The
files can then be extracted by the unix command: </p>

not included in order to limit the size of the tar file.  They can be
downloaded separately.</p>

<!---------------------------------------------------------------------->
<h3 class="style1">Grid</h3>

<p> The grid is contained in a <a href="https://www.grc.nasa.gov/WWW/wind/valid/plot3d.html">PLOT3D grid
file</a> (formatted, multi-zone, whole, three-dimensional) named <a href="https://www.grc.nasa.gov/WWW/wind/valid/m6wing/m6wing01/m6wing.x.fmt">m6wing.x.fmt</a>.  It consists of four zones wrapped
as a C-grid about the wing leading edge.  Table 1 lists the zones and 
dimensions.  The grid consists of a total of 316932 grid points.</p>

<p> The J1 surface of zone 2
contains the lower surface of the wing and the J1 surface of zone 3
contains the upper surface of the wing.  The K1 surfaces of all the
zones are on the symmetry plane.  The KMAX boundaries are coupled to
eachother as they envelope the wing tip.  The I1 surface of zone 1 and
the IMAX surface of zone 4 are the outflow boundaries.  The JMAX
surfaces of all the zones are on the farfield boundary.  The remaining
zone boundaries are coupled to other zone boundaries.  Figure 2 shows
the surfaces of the wing, outlines of the zones, and the grids on the
symmetry (K1) planes.  Figure 3 shows the grid about the tip of the
wing.  The grid is clustered about the wing surface to resolve the
boundary layer.  However, the spacing of the grid normal to the wing
surface is approximately 5.0E-05 feet, which will only resolve the
turbulent boundary layer with the first grid point off the wall of y+
of approximately 30.  Thus, the wall function will be used with this
grid.</p>

<p> The Plot3d grid file is converted to the common grid file (*.cgd)
format using the CFCNVT utility. This is done using the command:</p>

<blockquote>
  <b>cfcnvt &lt; <a href="https://www.grc.nasa.gov/WWW/wind/valid/m6wing/m6wing01/cfcnvt.x.com">cfcnvt.x.com</a></b>
</blockquote>

<p> where the file <a href="https://www.grc.nasa.gov/WWW/wind/valid/m6wing/m6wing01/cfcnvt.x.com">cfcnvt.x.com</a> is a command
input file directed to the standard Fortran input unit. A common grid 
file named <a href="https://www.grc.nasa.gov/WWW/wind/valid/m6wing/m6wing01/run.cgd">run.cgd</a> is created.</p>


<!---------------------------------------------------------------------->
<h3 class="style1">Boundary Conditions</h3>

<p> The boundaries at the surface of the wing are specified as
<b>VISCOUS WALL</b> boundary conditions.  The boundaries at the
symmetry plane are specified as <b>REFLECTION</b>  boundary conditions,
which is equivalent to an <b>INVISCID WALL</b> boundary condition.  The
boundaries at the outflow are specified as <b>OUTFLOW</b> boundary
conditions even though the flow is not truly confined.  This boundary
condition allows the pressure to be specified, which is set to the
freestream pressure.  The boundaries at the farfield are specified as
<b>FREESTREAM</b> boundary conditions, which uses one-dimensional
characteristic theory to set conditions.  The remaining boundaries are
<b>COUPLED</b> to other zone boundaries.</p>

<p> The boundary conditions are set within the common grid file <a href="https://www.grc.nasa.gov/WWW/wind/valid/m6wing/m6wing01/run.cgd">run.cgd</a> by using GMAN.  GMAN can be executed
using either a) an interactive graphics interface or b) in a batch
processing mode.  The interactive mode is illustrated using <a href="https://www.grc.nasa.gov/WWW/wind/valid/m6wing/m6wing01/m6wing.gman.html"> step-by-step</a> instructions.  The batch
processing mode is described below.</p>

<p> As GMAN operates, a journal file <b>gman.jou</b> is created which
can later be used as a command file to re-run GMAN in batch mode.  Here
this file has been renamed <a href="https://www.grc.nasa.gov/WWW/wind/valid/m6wing/m6wing01/gman.a.com"> gman.a.com</a> and
GMAN can be re-run as:</p>

<blockquote>
  <b>gman &lt; <a href="https://www.grc.nasa.gov/WWW/wind/valid/m6wing/m6wing01/gman.a.com">gman.a.com</a></b> 
</blockquote>

<p> where the file <a href="https://www.grc.nasa.gov/WWW/wind/valid/m6wing/m6wing01/gman.a.com">gman.a.com</a> is a command
input file (standard Fortran input unit). The commond grid file <a href="https://www.grc.nasa.gov/WWW/wind/valid/m6wing/m6wing01/run.cgd">run.cgd</a> is updated in the process.  In 
examining the file <a href="https://www.grc.nasa.gov/WWW/wind/valid/m6wing/m6wing01/gman.a.com">gman.a.com</a>, one can see 
that one sets boundary conditions by specifying the surface and then 
the boundary condition type.</p>

<p> An alternative to directly specifying the coupling between zone 
is to use the automatic coupling method in GMAN.  This can be done 
prior to setting the boundary conditions.  The procedure is:</p>

<blockquote>
   Pick <b> BOUNDARY COND. </b> <i>(left panel)</i> <br>
   Pick <b> AUTO COUPLE </b> <br>
   Pick <b> RUN AUTO COUP </b> <br>
</blockquote>

<p> GMAN will then search through each zone boundary and check to 
see if there are any other zone boundaries that are coincident.  Note 
that this may take a significant amount of time if there are a large 
number of zones and the grid is large.  It is suggested that one set 
the physical boundary conditions (i.e. viscous wall, freestream, etc...) 
prior to starting the automatic coupling search. Also note that automatic 
coupling will not detect a self-coupled boundary.</p>

<p> The command file to use the automatic coupling is 
<a href="https://www.grc.nasa.gov/WWW/wind/valid/m6wing/m6wing01/gman.b.com"> gman.b.com</a> 
and GMAN can be re-run as:</p>

<blockquote>
  <b>gman &lt; <a href="https://www.grc.nasa.gov/WWW/wind/valid/m6wing/m6wing01/gman.b.com">gman.b.com</a></b>
</blockquote>

<p> Upon completion of the batch operation, one should see the line 
"Congratulations, no undefined points left", which indicates that all 
boundary grid points have been assigned a boundary condition type or 
have been coupled to other boundary grid points.</p>
 

<!---------------------------------------------------------------------->
<h3 class="style1">Computation Strategy</h3>

<p> The computation is performed using the time-marching capabilities
of WIND to march to a steady-state (time asymptotic) solution starting 
from an initial solution.  Local time stepping is used at each iteration 
to enhance iterative convergence.  The flow is assumed to be fully 
turbulent.</p>


<!---------------------------------------------------------------------->
<h3 class="style1">Initial Conditions</h3>

<p> The initial flow conditions are the freestream flow values
as presented in Table 2.   These corresond to a Reynolds number of
11.72 million based on the mean aerodynamic chord length.  These
conditions match the Mach number, Reynolds number, and
angle-of-attack of test 2308 from the paper by Schmitt and Charpin in
AGARD Report AR-138 referenced below.  The static temperature was 
selected to be 460 degrees Rankine, which with the Mach and Reynolds 
number yielded a static pressure of 45.82899 psi.</p>

<!---------------------------------------------------------------------->
<h3 class="style1">Input Parameters and Files</h3>

<p> The WIND input data file for this case is <a href="https://www.grc.nasa.gov/WWW/wind/valid/m6wing/m6wing01/run.dat">run.dat</a>. The first three lines describe the flow
problem.  The <b>freestream</b> keyword indicates that the static
freestream flow conditions are specified as Mach number, pressure
(psia), temperature (R), angle-of-attack (degrees), and
angle-of-sideslip (degrees).  The <b>turbulence model</b> keyword
indicates that the Spalart-Allmaras turbulence model is to be used.
The <b>wall function</b> keyword indicates that the wall function is
used since the spacing of the first grid point off the wall will only
yield a y+ value of approximately 30.  The <b>implicit boundary</b>
keyword indicates that implicit boundary conditions are used at the
viscous wall boundaries.  The <b>dq limiter</b> keyword indicates that
changes in density and temperature over an iteration are limited to 50%
of the current value at each solution point.  The <b>downstream
pressure</b> keyword indicates that the freestream pressure is imposed
on the outflow boundaries specified with a <b>OUTFLOW</b> bounary
condition.  The <b>loads</b> keyword indicates that the forces on the
wing are to be integrated every 20 iterations and displayed in the
output list file.  This will we used to evaluate the convergence of the
solution.  The <b>cycles</b> keyword indicates that a maximum of 1000
cycles will be run.  The <b>iterations per cycle</b> keyword indicates
that 5 iterations will be run per cycle and that convergence
information will be written to the output list file every 5
iterations.  The <b>cfl</b> keyword indicates that a CFL number of 2.5
will be used.  By default, WIND uses local maximum allowable time-step
based on the specified CFL number.  The <b>converge order</b> keyword
indicates that the computation will stop if the L2 norm of the solution
drops by 9 orders-of-magnitude.</p>


<!---------------------------------------------------------------------->
<h3 class="style1">Computation</h3>

<p> The WIND solver is run on a UNIX computer by entering the command:</p>

<blockquote>
  <b>wind -runinplace -dat run -mp -parallel</b>
</blockquote>

<p> This runs the <b>wind</b> script which sets up the computation for
the solver.   Further details and options for the <b>wind</b> script
can be found in the WIND documentation 
(<a href="http://www.grc.nasa.gov/WWW/winddocs/user/scripts.html#scripts:scripts">wind
script</a>).  A brief description of script options can be listed by
typing:</p>

<blockquote>
  <b>wind -help</b>
</blockquote>

<p> The <b>-runinplace</b> option indicates that WIND is to be
run in the directory in which the <b>wind</b> script is executed.
Otherwise a temporary directory is created for the computation.</p>

<p> The <b>-dat run</b> option indicates that the input data file  
<a href="https://www.grc.nasa.gov/WWW/wind/valid/m6wing/m6wing01/run.dat">run.dat</a> has the prefix <b>run</b>.</p>

<p> The <b>-mp</b> option indicates that the computation is being
performed on a multi-processor computer.  The <b>-parallel</b> option
is used along with the <b>-mp</b> option to indicate that the
computation will be executed in parallel.   The parallel computing
capability also requires the creation of a multiple processor control
file named <a href="https://www.grc.nasa.gov/WWW/wind/valid/m6wing/m6wing01/run.mpc">run.mpc</a> that includes information on
how many processors to use.</p>

<p> To run WIND on one processor in serial mode, just use:</p>

<blockquote>
  <b>wind -runinplace -dat run</b>
</blockquote>

<p> Some interactive prompts ask for information to finish setting 
up the computation:</p> 

<p> First, one is asked to select the version of WIND that will be
used.  Hitting a "return" will default to selecting the latest
production version of WIND. There may be "alpha" or "beta" versions
listed that are currently under development and being tested.</p>

<p> The next three prompts ask for the names of the <b>output list file
(run.lis)</b>, <b>mesh file (run.cgd)</b>, and <b>flow data file
(run.cfl)</b>.  Hitting <b>Return</b> will default to using the prefix of
the <b>-dat</b> option.  If a flow data file with the specified name
exists, the computation will start from that solution.  Otherwise, a
solution will be initialized with the freestream conditions.  The wind
script will indicate whether an existing solution file has been found.</p>

<p> The next question allows a choice between running the solution in
<b>real-time (interactive)</b> or submitting it to a <b>queue</b>.</p> 

<p> <b>Running Real-Time</b>.  Running the computation in real-time
will give the computation a higher priority on the computer if several
jobs are already running.   The next questions asks whether the output
should be written to the screen.  Enter <b>n</b> so that screen output
is written to a list file named <b>run.lis</b>.   A "return" will cause 
the job to be submitted and the computation begun.</p>

<p> <b>Running in Batch</b>.  On an SGI workstation, a batch job will
be submitted to the AT queue.  The job may run with other jobs in the
queue, but may have lower priority.  The defaults may be chosen for the
remaining prompts.  The options exist to specify the start and end
times of the computation.  A "return" will cause the job
to be submitted and the computation begun.</p>

<p> The output list file is <a href="https://www.grc.nasa.gov/WWW/wind/valid/m6wing/m6wing01/run.lis">run.lis</a> and contains
the output from the computation and lists the residual information for
both the flow equations and the turbulence model equation for each
iteration.  The integrated forces for the top portion of the wing is
also output every 10 iterations.  When running parallel, the list file
also reports the multi-processor performance statistics.</p>

<p> The flow data file is <a href="https://www.grc.nasa.gov/WWW/wind/valid/m6wing/m6wing01/run.cfl">run.cfl</a> and
contains the final solution.</p>


<!---------------------------------------------------------------------->
<h3 class="style1">Iterative Convergence</h3>

<p> After running the computation, one must then demonstrate iterative 
convergence of the steady-state solution.  There are several ways to 
examine the iterative convergence:</p>


<p> <b>Residual of the Navier-Stokes Equations</b>.  The L2 norm of the
residual of the Navier-Stokes equations can be read from the output
list file <a href="https://www.grc.nasa.gov/WWW/wind/valid/m6wing/m6wing01/run.lis">run.lis</a>.  The RESPLT utility is used in
the form,</p>

<blockquote>

plot data file named <a href="https://www.grc.nasa.gov/WWW/wind/valid/m6wing/m6wing01/nsl2.gen">nsl2.gen</a> of the residuals
as a function of the number of iterations.  This file can be plotted 
using CFPOST,</p>

<p> <b>Residual of the Spalart-Allmaras Turbulence Model</b>.  The L2
norm of the residual of the governing equation used in the
Spalart-Allmaras turbulence model can be read from the output list file
<a href="https://www.grc.nasa.gov/WWW/wind/valid/m6wing/m6wing01/run.lis">run.lis</a>.  The RESPLT utility is used in the form</p>

           turbulence equation residuals.</b></p>


<p> <b>Wing Lift and Drag</b>.  Since determining the lift and drag of the wing is a 
primary engineering objective.  One can monitor the change of these values with 
iterations and determine the point of iterative convergence when these values 
no longer significantly change. The <b>loads</b>
keyword in the input data file <a href="https://www.grc.nasa.gov/WWW/wind/valid/m6wing/m6wing01/run.dat">run.dat</a>
outputs this information into the output list file <a href="https://www.grc.nasa.gov/WWW/wind/valid/m6wing/m6wing01/run.lis">run.lis</a>.  RESPLT is then used to read this
information and create plot files,</p>

plots for drag, lift, and z-direction force.  Figures 6 and 7 show the
convergence of the drag and lift as displayed by CFPOST.</p>

<!---------------------------------------------------------------------->
<h3 class="style1">Post-Processing</h3>

<p> The CFPOST utility can be used to generate engineering information 
from the the data files. </p> 


<p> <b>PLOT3D Grid and Solution Files</b>.  
The <a href="https://www.grc.nasa.gov/WWW/wind/valid/plot3d.html">PLOT3D grid and solution
files</a> can be obtained for use in commercial visualization software (i.e. 
Fieldview, Ensight, Tecplot) using the commands:</p>

<blockquote>
  <b>cfpost &lt;</b> <a href="https://www.grc.nasa.gov/WWW/wind/valid/m6wing/m6wing01/cfpost.plot3d.com">cfpost.plot3d.com</a>
</blockquote>

<p> The PLOT3D grid and solution files are named <b>run.x</b> and 
<b>run.q</b>, respectively.  They are unformatted, whole, 3D, and
multi-zone.</p>  


<p> <b>Mach Number Contour Plots</b>. The CFPOST utility can be used to
generate and plot flow contours at a cutting plane perpendicular to the
wing span.  Here the Mach number contours are generated and plotted at
section 1 (y/b=0.2),</p>

<blockquote>

</blockquote>


<p> <b>Pressure Coefficient Distribution</b>.  The referenced
experiment (Schmitt and Charpin, 1979) obtained pressure coefficients
at seven sections along the span of the wing.  Corresponding pressure
coefficients can be obtained from the WIND flow solution using CFPOST,</p>

<blockquote>
  <b>cfpost &lt;</b> <a href="https://www.grc.nasa.gov/WWW/wind/valid/m6wing/m6wing01/cfpost.zcut.cp1.com">cfpost.zcut.cp1.com</a>
</blockquote>

<p> where <a href="https://www.grc.nasa.gov/WWW/wind/valid/m6wing/m6wing01/cfpost.zcut.cp1.com">cfpost.zcut.cp1.com</a> is the
command input file for CFPOST to obtain the pressure coefficient at
section 1.  A GENPLOT file named <a href="https://www.grc.nasa.gov/WWW/wind/valid/m6wing/m6wing01/cp1.gen">cp1.gen</a> is
created and plotted.  The pressure coefficient is negative for
pressures less than freestream, which occurs on the top of the wing.
In plots of pressure coefficients for wings, the negative of the
pressure coefficient is usually plotted to indicate that the lower
pressure region is on the top of the wing and the high pressure region
is on the bottom of the wing.  This is done in the CFPOST command
files.  The data from the experiment is expressed with respect to the
local chord length.  A short Fortran 77 program, <a href="https://www.grc.nasa.gov/WWW/wind/valid/m6wing/m6wing01/readgen.f">readgen.f</a>, was written to transform the data in
the GENPLOT file to be consistent with the format used in the
experimental data. Figures 8 to 14 show the pressure coefficients at
each section along the wing.</p>

<p> <b>Forces on the Wing</b>.  For a wing calculation, another piece
of important information is the forces on the wing which result from
pressure and skin-friction.  CFPOST can be used to integrate these
forces over the surface of the wing,</p>

<blockquote>
  <b>cfpost &lt;</b> <a href="https://www.grc.nasa.gov/WWW/wind/valid/m6wing/m6wing01/cfpost.forces.com">cfpost.forces.com</a>
</blockquote>

<p> where <a href="https://www.grc.nasa.gov/WWW/wind/valid/m6wing/m6wing01/cfpost.forces.com">cfpost.forces.com</a> is the
command input file for CFPOST.  A list file named <a href="https://www.grc.nasa.gov/WWW/wind/valid/m6wing/m6wing01/forces.lis">forces.lis</a> is created in which the force
information is printed.</p>


<p> <b>Boundary Layer Properties</b>.  For a viscous computation, it is
useful to examine how well the turbulent boundary layers were
resolved.  One measure of this is the y+ values at the grid points in
the boundary layers.  The forces list file 
<a href="https://www.grc.nasa.gov/WWW/wind/valid/m6wing/m6wing01/forces.lis">forces.lis</a> does contain a summary of the y+
values near the walls. </p> 

<p> To examine the boundary layer at a certain
location, CFPOST can be used,</p>

<blockquote>
  <b>cfpost &lt;</b> <a href="https://www.grc.nasa.gov/WWW/wind/valid/m6wing/m6wing01/cfpost.blan.com">cfpost.blan.com</a>
</blockquote>

<p> The file <a href="https://www.grc.nasa.gov/WWW/wind/valid/m6wing/m6wing01/cfpost.blan.com">cfpost.blan.com</a> is a command
file which writes out the x and y coordinates, u-velocity, v-velocity,
static temperature, and y+ values along a grid line at I60, which is 
on the top of the wing just before the trailing edge.  This information 
is written to a GENPLOT file named <a href="https://www.grc.nasa.gov/WWW/wind/valid/m6wing/m6wing01/blan.gen">blan.gen</a>. </p>

<h3 class="style1">Comparisons of the Results</h3>

<p> In examining the pressure coefficient comparisons of Figs. 8-14, one
may conclude that the comparisons are good overall.  It appears that
there are two shocks on the upper surface at section 4 (y/b=0.80) which
WIND does not capture.  Determining the cause of differences between
the computation and experiment requires sensitivity studies with
respect to such things as the grid, turbulence model, and algorithms.
Refining the resolution of the boundary layer to y+ of 1 may improve
comparisons.   Further streamwise refinement of the grid would help
capture the shocks on the upper surface.</p>


<!---------------------------------------------------------------------->
<h3 class="style1">Performance</h3>

<p> The computations were performed on a Silicon Graphics Octane II
workstation using 2 600 MHZ IP30 MIPS R14000 Processors.  1000 cycles
for 5000 iterations required ? CPU seconds over an elapsed time
of ? seconds.</p>
